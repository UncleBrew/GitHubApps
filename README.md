# Description
With this assignment I was responsible for developing a site that uses a Git Hub API to populate potential candidates for potential employement. The site has a navigation bar that has a candidate search and saved candidates section, the candidate search section of the page populates a candidates github username and github id. Once the candidate has been portrayed you can either save the condidate or reject them and move on. The user can also navigate to the saved candidates and within that section they can view all of the saved candidates and delete a candidate that was once daved.
